# This is an example configuration file for tinifier.
#
# By default, this file is searched for in the user's configuration directory:
# - For Linux: `~/.configs/tinifier.yml`
# - For Windows: `%APPDATA%\tinifier.yml`
# - For macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/tinifier.yml`
#
# You can override this behavior by specifying the path to the configuration file using the `--config-file`
# flag or by setting the `CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

# Note: If you need to process a large number of files and have a Gmail account, you can use the following
# trick - register multiple accounts on tinypng.com using aliases such as `your_mailbox+key1@gmail.com`,
# `your_mailbox+key2@gmail.com`, etc. This allows you to use a single mailbox to retrieve as many free API
# keys as needed.
